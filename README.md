  I have designed a multi-page Power BI dashboard utilizing the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory) which contains high, low, open, and close prices for 💲23 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. and since the inception of these 23 cryptocurrencies, we can easily analyze patterns and anomalies.📈
